# Migration guide

## Migrating to v5 from v4

The only change v5 introduces is tenant scoping across the sdk.

### Tenant scoping

Skip this guide if you don't use multi-tenant architecture, i.e. if you don't pass tenant id in userToken jwt payload and don't use tenant id fields for preferences and in-app feed.

Pass `tenantId` in `identify` and the rest of the SDK, including preferences and in-app feed, uses it.

The per-call `tenantId` params in v4 still work and override the global one, so you can migrate gradually or leave your v4 code as is.

```javascript
// v5
await suprSendClient.identify(distinctId, userToken, {
  tenantId: "TENANT_ID",
});

// inherited — no need to repeat it in v5
await suprSendClient.user.preferences.getPreferences();

const feedClient = suprSendClient.feeds.initialize();
```

```javascript
// v4
await suprSendClient.identify(distinctId, userToken);

// tenant repeated at every call site
await suprSendClient.user.preferences.getPreferences({
  tenantId: "TENANT_ID",
});

const feedClient = suprSendClient.feeds.initialize({ tenantId: "TENANT_ID" });
```

**IMPORTANT**: Whichever tenant you pass in sdk, it must be included in `scope.tenant_id` of the [userToken](https://docs.suprsend.com/docs/client-authentication#enhanced-security-mode-with-signed-user-token), else the server throws scoping error.

v5 also adds below methods:

- `changeTenant(tenantId)` to switch the active tenant of an identified user without resetting the session. This is meant for user tokens that scope multiple tenants (`scope.tenant_id` as an array). Already running feed instances and previously fetched preferences keep the tenant they were initialized with — re-initialize the feed and call `getPreferences` again after switching. Refer [docs](../README.md#change-active-tenant).
- `track(event, properties, { tenantId })` to attribute a single event to a tenant. This doesn't change the active tenant of the session.

## Migrating to v4 from v3

This migration is pretty simple.

- Pagination related meta data keys have been changed in InApp Feed.

```javascript
// v4
pageInfo = {
  total: 0,
  pageSize: DEFAULT_PAGE_SIZE,
  hasMore: false, // this key is added in v4
};
```

```javascript
// v3
pageInfo = {
  total: 0,
  currentPage: 0, // this key is removed in v4
  totalPages: 0, // this key is removed in v4
  pageSize: DEFAULT_PAGE_SIZE,
};
```

## Migrating to v3 from v2

This migration is pretty simple. This version also supports InApp Feed support.

- SuprSend class export has been changed from default export to named export.

```javascript
// v3
import { SuprSend } from "@suprsend/web-sdk";
```

```javascript
// v2
import SuprSend from "@suprsend/web-sdk";
```

## Migrating to v2 from v1

Migrating from v1 to v2 has breaking changes, as we have made some architectural level changes. Refer the v1 SDK [documentation](https://github.com/suprsend/suprsend-browser-sdk/tree/main/docs). Following are changes in detail:

### Authentication changes

In v1, workspace key and workspace secret are used to authenticate requests made to SuprSend which is not so secure.

In v2 we have changed authentication to use public API Key and Signed User Token.

```javascript
// v2
const suprSendClient = new SuprSend(publicApiKey);

suprSendClient.idenitfy(distinctId, userToken);
```

```javascript
// v1
suprsend.init(workspace_key, workspace_secret);
```

### Initializing SDK

v1 used `init` method to initialize SDK and suprsend instance was provided by SDK itself.

In v2 we have provided `SuprSend` class and its clients responsibility to export the class instance and use it in other places to call library methods.

```javascript
// v2
export const suprSendClient = new SuprSend(publicApiKey);

suprSendClient.track("test");
```

```text
// v1
suprsend.init(workspace_key, workspace_secret);

suprsend.track("test")
```

### Synchronous methods

In v1 all methods used to be asynchronous and have returned void. In background SDK used to batch requests and make API calls.

In v2 we have made all requests synchronous so you could access response of API immediately depending of status of API call. Almost all methods including preference methods return response type of [API Response](../README.md#response-structure).

```javascript
// v2
const trackResponse = await suprSendClient.track("test");

console.log(trackResponse.status); // success or error
```

```javascript
// v1
const resp = suprsend.track("test"); // resp will be null
```

### Renamed methods and arguments to camelCase

In v1, all library methods and method parameters are in snake_case which has been changed to camelCase in v2.

```javascript
// v2 examples
suprSendClient.user.addEmail();
suprSendClient.user.preferences.getPreferences({ tenantId: "test" });
```

```javascript
// v1 examples
suprsend.user.add_email();
suprsend.user.preferences.get_preferences({ tenant_id: "test" });
```

### Removed `purchase_made` method

In v2 `purchase_made` method has been removed. If you are using this method in v1 you can directly call track method with event type: `$purchase_made`.

```javascript
// v2
suprSendClient.track("$purchase_made", { item: "ps5" });
```

```javascript
// v1
suprsend.purchase_made({ item: "ps5" });
```

### Removed `set_super_properties`

In v2 `set_super_properties` method has been removed. If you are using this method in v1 you could directly pass all these super properties as individual event properties.

After migrating please test all library methods to see if they everything is working properly.
